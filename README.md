# Customer Tracker

Turn your R code into reports, presentations, dashboards, apps, and API's with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), and [Plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/). This repos shows 9 different data products built on the same data set. Use whatever output type is appropriate for your situation. After you create your content, you can publish it to [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/).

## Data Explanation

<center><a href="http://colorado.rstudio.com:3939/Tracker/README.html"><img src="img/tracker.png" width="500"/></a></center>

These reports show year over year performance for many customer segments and product groups. Top level performance (i.e. revenue) is decomposed into lower level performance metrics (i.e. customer visits, items purchased, and checkout spend). For example, in week 1 revenue for the all segments and products increased by 22.9 compared to last year. The main contributors to the increase were visits (+12.1%) and spend (+6.3%).
